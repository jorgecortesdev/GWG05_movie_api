    <p>
        It`s
        become essential that you be able to interface with (as you did in Achievement 1) and even create
        your own APIs. For this reason, throughout this Achievement, you`ll create a REST API for an
        application called "myFlix" that interacts with a database that stores data about different movies.
        In the next Achievement, you`ll build the client-side component of this same application using REACT.
        By the end of Achievement 3, you`ll have a complete web application (client-side and server-side) built
        using full-stack JavaScript technologies that you can showcase in your portfolio. The project will
        demonstrate your mastery of full-stack JavaScript development, including APIs, web server
        frameworks, databases, business logic, authentication, data security, and more. The complete tech
        stack you`ll master is known as the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js) stack.
